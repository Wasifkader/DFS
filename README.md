# DFS
The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that uses the idea of backtracking. It involves exhaustive searches of all the nodes by going ahead, if possible, else by backtracking.
Complexity O(V+E),where v is total vertices and e is total edges.
Application:
1) For an unweighted graph, DFS traversal of the graph produces the minimum spanning tree and all pair shortest path tree.        
2) Detecting cycle in a graph         
3) Path Finding            
4) Topological Sorting         
5) To test if a graph is bipartite          
6) Finding Strongly Connected Components of a graph        
7) Solving puzzles with only one solution.
